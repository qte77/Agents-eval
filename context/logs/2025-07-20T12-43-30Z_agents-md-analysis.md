# AGENTS.md Analysis Report

## Enhancements Needed

### 1. Missing Path References

- Variables like `$DOCS_PATH`, `$PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS`, `$ADR_PATH` are referenced but never defined
- Should be resolved using the paths.md configuration or explicitly defined

### 2. Typos & Grammar Issues

- **Line 8:** "Sofware" → "Software"
- **Line 9:** "an Behavior" → "a Behavior"
- **Line 14:** "davance" → "advance"
- **Line 150:** "weel-defined" → "well-defined"

### 3. Inconsistent Variable Usage

- **Line 7:** References `DEFAULT_PATHS = context/config/paths.md` but should use `$DEFAULT_PATHS`
- Missing variable definitions for paths referenced throughout

### 4. Structural Issues

- **Line 47:** "See `$DEFAULT_PATHS`" is too vague - should specify which section
- **Line 18:** Path inconsistency - `${APP_PATH}/src/gui/` should be `src/gui/` based on paths.md

## Problems That Disturb Workflow

### 1. Undefined Variables

- Cannot resolve `$DOCS_PATH`, `$PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS`, `$ADR_PATH`, etc.
- Forces agents to make assumptions or ask for clarification

### 2. Path Inconsistencies

- GUI path mismatch between AGENTS.md and paths.md creates confusion
- Need to cross-reference multiple files to understand structure

### 3. Missing Context

- "Requests to Humans" section has technical debt items but lacks priority/severity
- No clear process for how agents should handle these blockers

## Workflow Improvements Needed

### 1. Variable Resolution System

- Add clear variable definitions at top of file
- Use consistent `$VARIABLE` syntax throughout
- Reference paths.md more explicitly

### 2. Better Structure

- Add table of contents
- Group related sections better
- Add quick reference section for common commands

### 3. Agent Decision Framework

- Add section on how to handle conflicting instructions
- Clarify priority when AGENTS.md conflicts with other files
- Define escalation process for unclear requirements

## Suggestions

### 1. Add Variable Definitions Section

```markdown
## Variable Definitions
- `$APP_PATH`: src/app
- `$DOCS_PATH`: docs
- `$PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS`: pyproject.toml
[etc.]
```

### 2. Improve "Requests to Humans" Format

Add priority levels and impact assessment:

```markdown
* [ ] **HIGH**: NotImplementedError in agent_system.py streaming
* [ ] **MEDIUM**: Missing Gemini/HuggingFace implementations
```

### 3. Add Agent Workflow Section

- Decision trees for common scenarios
- Clear escalation paths
- Conflict resolution guidelines

## Summary

The AGENTS.md file serves as a comprehensive guide but suffers from undefined variables, typos, and structural inconsistencies that impede agent workflow efficiency. Primary focus should be on resolving path variables and improving the decision-making framework for agents.
