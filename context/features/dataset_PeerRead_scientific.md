# Feature Specification: PeerRead Dataset Integration

## FEATURE

Implement PeerRead dataset integration as a benchmark for the Multi-Agent System (MAS) evaluation framework. The data has to be made available for other components of this project. The dataset will enable benchmarking of scientific paper review quality of the MAS. Meaning the MAS will review papers contained in PeerRead and the results will be benchmarked against the reviews contained in PeeRead.

- Only include necessary components and be concise while implementing. Think of MVP with basic features, e.g., download dataset, provide means to load the dataset.
- Use the paths defined in `context/config/paths.md`

## EXAMPLES

### Agent Task Format

```python
{
    "paper_id": "acl_2017_001",
    "title": "Neural Machine Translation with Attention",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel attention mechanism...",
    "agent_task": "Provide a peer review with rating (1-10) and recommendation",
    "expected_output": {
        "rating": 7,
        "recommendation": "accept",
        "review_text": "This paper presents solid work..."
    }
}
```

## DOCUMENTATION

- **Paper**: [A Dataset of Peer Reviews (PeerRead): Collection, Insights and NLP Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09635)
- **Data**: [PeerRead - data](https://github.com/allenai/PeerRead/tree/master/data)
- **Code`: [PeeRead - code](https://github.com/allenai/PeerRead/tree/master/code)
- **Integration**: Follows existing patterns in `$DATAMODELS_PATH`
- **Testing**: Follows existing pytest patterns in `tests/test_peerread_*.py`

## IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

- Data Management, Dependencies, Testing Strategy, Error Handling
- Configuration has to be made available in a separate file
- Loading the data has to be possible using functions or small classes
- Performance considerations, e.g. data set size batches of chunks
