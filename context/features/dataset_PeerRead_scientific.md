# Feature Specification: PeerRead Dataset Integration

## FEATURE

Implement PeerRead dataset integration as a benchmark for the Multi-Agent System evaluation framework. The data has to be made available for other components of this project. The dataset will enable benchmarking of scientific paper review quality using the existing agent architecture which can be constructed as single LLM or multi-agentic like Manager → Researcher → Analyst → Synthesizer.

## EXAMPLES

### Agent Task Format

```python
{
    "paper_id": "acl_2017_001",
    "title": "Neural Machine Translation with Attention",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel attention mechanism...",
    "agent_task": "Provide a peer review with rating (1-10) and recommendation",
    "expected_output": {
        "rating": 7,
        "recommendation": "accept",
        "review_text": "This paper presents solid work..."
    }
}
```

## DOCUMENTATION

- **Paper**: [A Dataset of Peer Reviews (PeerRead): Collection, Insights and NLP Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09635)
- **Data**: [PeerRead - data](https://github.com/allenai/PeerRead/tree/master/data)
- **Integration**: Follows existing patterns in `src/app/config/data_models.py`
- **Testing**: Follows existing pytest patterns in `tests/test_peerread_*.py`

## IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

- Data Management, Dependencies, Testing Strategy, Error Handling
- Configuration has to be made available in a separate file
- Loading the data has to be possible using functions or classes
- Performance considerations, e.g. data set size
