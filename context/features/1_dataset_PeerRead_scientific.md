# Feature description for: PeerRead Dataset Integration

Use the paths defined in `context/config/paths.md`

## User Story

**As a** system i need acces to the PeerRead dataset
**I want** easy downloading, loading and usage of the dataset
**So that** i can use the dataset for benchmarking of the multi-agentic system

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] dataset can be downloaded using a function or method
- [ ] dataset can be loaded by the system using a function or method
- [ ] usage of the dataset is documented, e.g., how to download and use the dataset

## Feature Description

### What

Implement PeerRead dataset download and integration. The dataset has to be made available for other components of this project.

### Why

The dataset will enable benchmarking of scientific paper review quality of the MAS. Meaning the MAS will review papers contained in PeerRead and the results will be benchmarked against the reviews contained in PeeRead.

### Scope

Downloading and using the dataset.

## Implementation Guidance

### Complexity Estimate

- [ ] **Simple** (< 200 lines)
- [x] **Medium** (200-400 lines)
- [ ] **Complex** (> 400 lines)

## Examples

### Agent Task Format

```python
{
    "paper_id": "acl_2017_001",
    "title": "Neural Machine Translation with Attention",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel attention mechanism...",
    "agent_task": "Provide a peer review with rating (1-10) and recommendation",
    "expected_output": {
        "rating": 7,
        "recommendation": "accept",
        "review_text": "This paper presents solid work..."
    }
}
```

### Documentation Updates

- [x] Update `$CHANGELOG_PATH` with concise descriptions of most important changes

## Other Considerations

- Configuration has to be made available in a separate file
- Data Management, Dependencies, Testing Strategy, Error Handling
- Performance considerations, e.g. data set size batches of chunks
