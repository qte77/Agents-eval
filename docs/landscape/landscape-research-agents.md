**These frameworks enable research agent development or provide specialized research support capabilities:**

- [Paper2Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06917) - Automated framework converting research papers into interactive AI agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for reliable scientific assistance. **Core Features**: **Paper-to-Agent Conversion** - Systematically analyzes papers and codebases using multiple agents, constructs MCP servers from research publications automatically, iteratively generates and runs tests to refine agent robustness; **Interactive Research Assistants** - Transforms passive papers into active systems accelerating adoption and discovery, enables complex scientific queries through natural language, invokes tools and workflows from original papers; **Reproducibility & Extension** - Agents reproduce original paper results accurately, correctly handle novel user queries beyond paper scope, supports single-cell analysis (ScanPy, TISSUE) and genomic interpretation (AlphaGenome); **New Paradigm** - Foundation for collaborative AI co-scientist ecosystem, revolutionizes knowledge dissemination and research interaction, accelerates downstream use and adaptation of published methods. **Technical Implementation**: Multi-agent system for paper and code analysis, MCP server architecture for tool integration, automated testing and refinement pipeline, integrates with Claude Code and other chat agents. **High feasibility** with open research from September 2025, clear methodology, published arxiv paper with implementation details. **Integration:** Convert PeerRead evaluation papers into interactive agents for methodology reproduction, enable natural language queries about review generation techniques, establish automated testing for evaluation workflow validation and refinement. **Sources:** [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06917), [HTML Version](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.06917v1)

- [PaperQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07559) - Open-source RAG agent for answering questions over scientific literature with focus on reducing hallucinations and providing answer provenance. **Core Features**: **Scientific Literature RAG** - Information retrieval across full-text scientific articles, relevance assessment of sources and passages, hallucination reduction through grounded retrieval; **Provenance Tracking** - Provides source attribution for all answers, transparent citation of evidence, verifiable answer generation process. **Technical Implementation**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture, full-text scientific article processing, relevance scoring algorithms, source attribution system. **High feasibility** with open-source availability, proven RAG approach, research validation. **Integration:** Implement grounded question-answering for PeerRead evaluation using scientific literature retrieval, apply hallucination reduction techniques for reliable review generation, establish provenance tracking for transparent evaluation evidence. **Sources:** [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07559), [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/whitead/paper-qa)
