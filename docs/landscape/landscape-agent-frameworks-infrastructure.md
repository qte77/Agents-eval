**MCP Security Considerations (IMPORTANT):**

Research findings from 2025 have identified critical security concerns with MCP server deployments that require careful attention:

- **Authentication Gaps**: Knostic security research (July 2025) scanned nearly 2,000 MCP servers exposed to the internet and found all verified servers lacking any form of authentication, meaning anyone could access internal tool listings and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data
- **Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities**: Multiple outstanding security issues identified in April 2025 including prompt injection attacks that can manipulate agent behavior
- **Tool Permission Risks**: Combining tools can create unintended data exfiltration pathways, allowing sensitive information to leak through seemingly benign tool combinations
- **Lookalike Tool Attacks**: Malicious lookalike tools can silently replace trusted ones, compromising agent operations without detection
- **Deployment Recommendations**:
  - Always implement authentication and authorization for MCP servers
  - Use network isolation and firewalls to restrict MCP server access
  - Regularly audit tool permissions and combinations for security risks
  - Validate tool sources and maintain allowlists of trusted tools
  - Monitor MCP server logs for suspicious access patterns
  - Follow security best practices from MCP protocol documentation

**Integration Impact**: When deploying PeerRead evaluation agents with MCP connectivity, implement mandatory authentication for all MCP servers, establish secure network boundaries isolating evaluation infrastructure, audit tool combinations for data leakage risks, and maintain comprehensive logging for security monitoring and incident response.

- **Agentic Systems Proposal**: [Semantic Conventions for GenAI Agentic Systems](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/2664) defines attributes for tracing tasks, actions, agents, teams, artifacts, and memory across complex AI workflows
- **Core Components**: Standardized metrics, traces, logs, evaluations, and governance for comprehensive AI agent visibility
- **Framework Support**: Growing adoption across observability platforms (Arize Phoenix, Langtrace, Langfuse, Pydantic Logfire) with OpenTelemetry-compatible tracing
- **Production Benefits**: Enables vendor-neutral observability, consistent instrumentation across frameworks, interoperable monitoring and evaluation tools
- **Integration Impact**: PeerRead evaluation agents can leverage OpenTelemetry standards for framework-agnostic observability, portable trace data across tools, and industry-standard instrumentation patterns

For additional observability platforms including LangWatch, MLflow, Uptrace, Traceloop, and limited local support options, see [Evaluation & Data Resources Landscape](landscape-evaluation-data-resources.md#llm-application-observability) which covers the full spectrum of observability solutions.

**Enterprise/Commercial (Evaluation Focused):**

For enterprise observability solutions including Neptune.ai, Weights & Biases (Weave), Evidently AI, and Dynatrace, see [Evaluation & Data Resources Landscape](landscape-evaluation-data-resources.md#enterprisecommercial-evaluation-focused) which covers comprehensive enterprise monitoring platforms.

**Cloud-Only (Not Suitable):**

- [AgentOps](https://www.agentops.ai/) - Cloud-focused Python SDK for AI agent monitoring with multi-agent collaboration analysis and specialized agent observability features. **Tracing Method**: Python SDK with `agentops.init()` automatic session tracking and `@agentops.record()` decorators. Uses callback-based collection with cloud-based analytics and remote data storage via proprietary API endpoints. **Low feasibility** for local evaluation due to cloud dependency and limited data export documentation.
