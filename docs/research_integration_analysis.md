## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals convergence between cutting-edge academic research, production-ready frameworks, and the Agents-eval project architecture. By synthesizing insights from 50+ research papers and 4 production frameworks, we identify an opportunity to position Agents-eval as research-to-production evaluation framework for agentic AI systems.

**Key Finding**: All analyzed sources converge on multi-dimensional evaluation approaches, with Agents-eval's three-tier system (Traditional + LLM-as-Judge + Graph-based) serving as an ideal foundation for integration.
