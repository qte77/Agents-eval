# Sprint 1: PeerRead Dataset Agent Evaluation Framework

## Sprint Dates: August 23-28, 2025 (6 Days)

## Executive Summary

**Project Goal**: Assess and evaluate AI agents on the PeerRead dataset by implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures agent performance in generating academic paper reviews through multiple evaluation approaches.

**Key Requirements**:

- Large context window models to ingest full PeerRead dataset papers
- Traditional evaluation metrics (text similarity, execution time)
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation for review quality and agentic execution assessment
- Graph-based complexity analysis of tool and agent interactions
- Composite scoring system: (agentic results / execution time / graph complexity)

**Sprint Goals**: Implement comprehensive PeerRead evaluation framework with traditional, LLM-judge, and graph-based evaluation approaches to enable agent performance scoring.

## Evaluation Framework Overview

### Traditional Evaluation Metrics (from config_eval.json)

- **Output Similarity**: Compare generated reviews to PeerRead reference reviews using cosine, jaccard, and semantic similarity  
- **Time Taken**: Measure agent processing time for paper ingestion and review generation
- **Task Success**: Assess successful completion of review generation task with confidence threshold (0.8)

### Advanced Evaluation Metrics (from config_eval.json)

- **Coordination Quality**: Assess multi-agent interactions and workflow efficiency between Manager/Researcher/Analyst/Synthesizer
- **Tool Efficiency**: Evaluate effectiveness of DuckDuckGo search and PeerRead-specific tools usage
- **Planning Rational**: Assess reasoning quality and decision-making processes in agent orchestration

### Graph-Based Complexity Analysis

- **Tool Call Complexity**: Analyze patterns and efficiency of tool utilizations
- **Agent Interaction Graphs**: Map and measure complexity of agent-to-agent communications
- **Execution Flow Analysis**: Compare actual vs. expected execution patterns

### Composite Scoring Formula (from config_eval.json)

```python
# Equal weights for all 6 metrics (0.167 each)
Agent Score = (
    time_taken * 0.167 +
    task_success * 0.167 + 
    coordination_quality * 0.167 +
    tool_efficiency * 0.167 +
    planning_rational * 0.167 +
    output_similarity * 0.167
)
```

**Recommendation Weights**: Accept (1.0), Weak Accept (0.7), Weak Reject (-0.7), Reject (-1.0)  
**Confidence Threshold**: 0.8 for task success evaluation

### Model Requirements

- **Large Context Windows**: Models capable of processing full PeerRead papers (>50k tokens, preferably 200k+ for full papers)
- **Suggested Models**:
  - **Claude-3.5-Sonnet** (200k context limit, Anthropic provider)
  - **GPT-4 Turbo** (128k context limit, OpenAI provider)  
  - **Gemini-1.5-Pro** (1M context limit, Google provider)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Intelligent document chunking for smaller context models
- **Implementation**: Model selection logic based on paper token count with automatic fallback

### Implementation Architecture Details

#### Config-Based Evaluation Implementation

```python
# Extends existing src/app/evals/metrics.py (time_taken, output_similarity already exist)
class ConfigBasedEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str = "src/app/config/config_eval.json"):
        self.config = load_config(config_path)
        self.weights = self.config["metrics_and_weights"]  # All 6 metrics with 0.167 weights
        self.similarity_metrics = self.config["evaluation"]["similarity_metrics"]  # cosine, jaccard, semantic
        
    def calculate_output_similarity(self, generated: str, reference: str) -> float:
        """Calculate similarity using config-defined methods."""
        return self._multi_similarity(generated, reference, self.similarity_metrics)
    
    def time_taken(self, start_time: float, end_time: float) -> float:
        """Existing implementation - execution time tracking."""
        return end_time - start_time
    
    def evaluate_task_success(self, generated_review: str, confidence: float) -> float:
        """Task completion assessment with confidence threshold (0.8)."""
        return 1.0 if confidence >= self.config["evaluation"]["confidence_threshold"] else 0.0
```

#### Advanced Metrics Implementation

```python
# src/app/evals/advanced_metrics.py - New metrics from config_eval.json
class AdvancedEvaluator:
    def evaluate_coordination_quality(self, agent_interactions: List[Dict]) -> float:
        """Assess Manager->Researcher->Analyst->Synthesizer coordination efficiency."""
        coordination_score = self._analyze_delegation_patterns(agent_interactions)
        return min(1.0, max(0.0, coordination_score))
    
    def evaluate_tool_efficiency(self, tool_calls: List[Dict]) -> float:
        """Assess DuckDuckGo search and PeerRead tools usage effectiveness."""
        efficiency_metrics = self._analyze_tool_usage(tool_calls)
        return efficiency_metrics["success_rate"] * efficiency_metrics["response_time_factor"]
    
    def evaluate_planning_rational(self, decision_trace: List[Dict]) -> float:
        """Assess reasoning quality in agent decision-making processes."""
        rationality_score = self._analyze_decision_quality(decision_trace)
        return rationality_score
```

#### Graph-Based Complexity Analysis

```python
# src/app/evals/graph_complexity.py
class GraphComplexityEvaluator:
    def build_execution_graph(self, execution_trace: List[Dict]) -> nx.DiGraph:
        """Convert execution trace to directed graph representation."""
        graph = nx.DiGraph()
        for step in execution_trace:
            self._add_execution_step(graph, step)
        return graph
    
    def calculate_complexity_metrics(self, graph: nx.DiGraph) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate various graph complexity measures."""
        return {
            "node_count": graph.number_of_nodes(),
            "edge_density": nx.density(graph),
            "cyclic_complexity": self._calculate_cyclomatic_complexity(graph),
            "average_path_length": nx.average_shortest_path_length(graph),
            "betweenness_centrality": max(nx.betweenness_centrality(graph).values())
        }
```

#### Composite Scoring System

```python
# src/app/evals/composite_scorer.py - Using config_eval.json structure  
class CompositeScorer:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str = "src/app/config/config_eval.json"):
        self.config = load_config(config_path)
        self.weights = self.config["metrics_and_weights"]  # All 0.167 equal weights
        self.recommendation_weights = self.config["evaluation"]["recommendation_weights"]
    
    def calculate_agent_score(self, metrics_results: Dict[str, float]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Calculate final score using config_eval.json weighted approach."""
        
        # Apply config weights to all 6 metrics
        weighted_score = (
            metrics_results["time_taken"] * self.weights["time_taken"] +
            metrics_results["task_success"] * self.weights["task_success"] + 
            metrics_results["coordination_quality"] * self.weights["coordination_quality"] +
            metrics_results["tool_efficiency"] * self.weights["tool_efficiency"] +
            metrics_results["planning_rational"] * self.weights["planning_rational"] +
            metrics_results["output_similarity"] * self.weights["output_similarity"]
        )
        
        # Apply recommendation weights based on performance
        if weighted_score >= 0.8: recommendation = "accept"
        elif weighted_score >= 0.6: recommendation = "weak_accept" 
        elif weighted_score >= 0.4: recommendation = "weak_reject"
        else: recommendation = "reject"
        
        final_score = weighted_score * self.recommendation_weights[recommendation]
        
        return {
            "final_score": final_score,
            "weighted_score": weighted_score,
            "recommendation": recommendation,
            "individual_metrics": metrics_results
        }
