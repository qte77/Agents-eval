# Sprint 1: Core Evaluation Framework Implementation

## Sprint Dates: August 23-28, 2025 (6 Days)

## Executive Summary

**Critical Issue**: The Agents-eval project has a fundamental disconnect between its stated goals (comprehensive agentic AI system evaluation) and current implementation (primarily review generation system).

**Key Gaps**:

- Only 2 trivial metrics exist (`time_taken`, `output_similarity`)
- 6 config-defined metrics missing (`planning_rational`, `task_success`, `tool_efficiency`, `coordination_quality`, `text_similarity`)
- LLM-as-Judge framework absent (marked "TODO")

**Sprint Goals**: Implement missing evaluation metrics framework, bridge documentation-implementation gap, establish foundation for advanced features.
