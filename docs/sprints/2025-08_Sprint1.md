# Sprint 1: PeerRead Dataset Agent Evaluation Framework

## Sprint Dates: August 23-28, 2025 (6 Days)

**Sprint Goal**: Implement a comprehensive three-tiered evaluation framework (Traditional + LLM-as-Judge + Graph-based) with research-backed enhancements for assessing multi-agent systems on PeerRead scientific paper review generation, establishing a solid foundation for advanced architectural development.

**Priority**: Critical Priority for evaluation framework foundation and Sprint 2 architectural prerequisites

## Executive Summary

**Project Goal**: Assess and evaluate AI agents on the PeerRead dataset by implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures agent performance in generating academic paper reviews through multiple evaluation approaches.

**Key Requirements**:

- Large context window models to ingest full PeerRead dataset papers
- Traditional evaluation metrics (text similarity, execution time)
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation for review quality and agentic execution assessment
- Graph-based complexity analysis of tool and agent interactions
- Composite scoring system: (agentic results / execution time / graph complexity)

**Sprint Goals**: Implement comprehensive PeerRead evaluation framework with traditional, LLM-judge, and graph-based evaluation approaches to enable agent performance scoring. See [Evaluation Approach Decision Tree](../architecture.md#evaluation-approach-decision-tree) for guidance on approach selection.

## Three-Tiered Evaluation Engine Strategy

### Composite Scoring Formula (from config_eval.json)

```python
# Equal weights for all 6 metrics (0.167 each)
Agent Score = (
    time_taken * 0.167 +
    task_success * 0.167 + 
    coordination_quality * 0.167 +
    tool_efficiency * 0.167 +
    planning_rational * 0.167 +
