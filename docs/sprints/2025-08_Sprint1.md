# Sprint 1: PeerRead Dataset Agent Evaluation Framework

## Sprint Dates: August 23-28, 2025 (6 Days)

## Executive Summary

**Project Goal**: Assess and evaluate AI agents on the PeerRead dataset by implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures agent performance in generating academic paper reviews through multiple evaluation approaches.

**Key Requirements**:

- Large context window models to ingest full PeerRead dataset papers
- Traditional evaluation metrics (text similarity, execution time)
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation for review quality and agentic execution assessment
- Graph-based complexity analysis of tool and agent interactions
- Composite scoring system: (agentic results / execution time / graph complexity)

**Sprint Goals**: Implement comprehensive PeerRead evaluation framework with traditional, LLM-judge, and graph-based evaluation approaches to enable agent performance scoring.

## Evaluation Framework Overview

### Traditional Evaluation Metrics

- **Text Similarity**: Compare generated reviews to PeerRead provided reviews using semantic similarity measures
- **Execution Time**: Measure agent processing time for paper ingestion and review generation
- **Output Quality**: Assess review completeness, structure, and adherence to academic standards

### LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation

- **Review Quality Assessment**: Judge similarity between generated and reference reviews
- **Agentic Execution Assessment**: Evaluate tool usage, reasoning quality, and decision-making processes
- **Agent Coordination**: Assess multi-agent interactions and workflow efficiency

### Graph-Based Complexity Analysis

- **Tool Call Complexity**: Analyze patterns and efficiency of tool utilizations
- **Agent Interaction Graphs**: Map and measure complexity of agent-to-agent communications
- **Execution Flow Analysis**: Compare actual vs. expected execution patterns

### Composite Scoring Formula

```python
Agent Score = (Agentic Results Quality) / (Execution Time) / (Graph Complexity)
```

Higher scores indicate better performance with efficient execution and manageable complexity.

### Model Requirements

- **Large Context Windows**: Models capable of processing full PeerRead papers (>50k tokens, preferably 200k+ for full papers)
- **Suggested Models**:
  - **Claude-3.5-Sonnet** (200k context limit, Anthropic provider)
  - **GPT-4 Turbo** (128k context limit, OpenAI provider)  
  - **Gemini-1.5-Pro** (1M context limit, Google provider)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Intelligent document chunking for smaller context models
- **Implementation**: Model selection logic based on paper token count with automatic fallback

        for step in execution_trace:
            self._add_execution_step(graph, step)
        return graph
    
    def calculate_complexity_metrics(self, graph: nx.DiGraph) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate various graph complexity measures."""
        return {
            "node_count": graph.number_of_nodes(),

            "betweenness_centrality": max(nx.betweenness_centrality(graph).values())
        }
```

#### Composite Scoring System

```python
# src/app/evals/composite_scorer.py  
class CompositeScorer:
    def __init__(self, similarity_weight: float = 0.4, quality_weight: float = 0.3, 
                 efficiency_weight: float = 0.2, complexity_weight: float = 0.1):

            "efficiency": efficiency_weight,
            "complexity": complexity_weight
        }
    
    def calculate_agent_score(self, evaluation_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate final composite score and component breakdowns."""
        similarity_score = self._aggregate_similarity_scores(evaluation_results["traditional"])
        quality_score = self._aggregate_quality_scores(evaluation_results["llm_judge"])
        efficiency_score = self._calculate_efficiency_score(evaluation_results["execution_time"])
        complexity_penalty = self._calculate_complexity_penalty(evaluation_results["graph_metrics"])
        
        composite_score = (
            (similarity_score * self.weights["similarity"] + quality_score * self.weights["quality"]) 
            / (efficiency_score * self.weights["efficiency"] + complexity_penalty * self.weights["complexity"])
        )
        
        return {
