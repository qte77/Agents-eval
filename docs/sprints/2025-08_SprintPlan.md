# Sprint Plan: Core Evaluation Framework Implementation

## Sprint Dates: August 10-15, 2025 (6 Days)

## Executive Summary

**Critical Issue**: The Agents-eval project has a fundamental disconnect between its stated goals (comprehensive agentic AI system evaluation) and current implementation (primarily review generation system). This sprint addresses the core evaluation pipeline gaps identified during system analysis.

## Identified Critical Issues

### üö® **Priority 1: Evaluation Pipeline Gap (MAJOR)**

- **Current State**: Only 2 trivial placeholder metrics exist (`time_taken`, `output_similarity`)
- **Expected State**: Comprehensive evaluation framework for agentic AI systems
- **Impact**: Project's primary goal completely unmet

### üö® **Priority 2: Missing Core Metrics Implementation**

- **Config Promises**: 6 evaluation metrics with defined weights
- **Reality**: `planning_rational`, `task_success`, `tool_efficiency`, `coordination_quality`, `text_similarity` are missing
- **Gap**: 83% of promised evaluation capabilities not implemented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Priority 3: LLM-as-Judge Framework Absent**

- **Documentation**: Section exists but marked as "TODO"
- **Implementation**: No judge system found
- **Need**: Core component for automated evaluation

## Sprint Goals

1. **Establish Core Evaluation Pipeline**: Implement missing evaluation metrics framework
2. **Bridge Documentation-Implementation Gap**: Align actual capabilities with stated goals
3. **Foundation for Advanced Features**: Enable future enhancements from blog post recommendations

## Implementation Tools & Resources Analysis

### **Available Development Tools ‚úÖ**

**Core Implementation Capabilities:**

- **File Operations**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit for all code changes
- **Testing**: Bash tool integration with `make test_all`, `make validate`, `make ruff`
- **Search & Navigation**: Grep, Glob for efficient codebase exploration
- **Documentation**: Full markdown editing with markdownlint compliance
- **Package Management**: `uv` integration via existing Makefile commands

**Existing Infrastructure:**

- **Framework**: PydanticAI already integrated for agent orchestration
- **Configuration**: JSON-based config system for providers and metrics
- **Testing**: pytest framework with existing test structure
- **API Access**: Multiple LLM provider configurations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)
- **Data Pipeline**: PeerRead dataset integration functional

### **Implementation Strategy for Effortless Success**

#### **Phase 1: FRP-Guided Foundation (Days 1-2)**

**Claude Code Custom Commands Integration:**

- **`/generate-frp evaluation-metrics-framework`**: Automated codebase pattern research and implementation planning
- **`/execute-frp evaluation-metrics-framework`**: Structured implementation with TodoWrite progress tracking
- **Sub-Agent Integration**: Backend-architect for system design, code-reviewer for quality assurance
- **Automated Quality Validation**: AGENTS.md Quality Evaluation Framework built into FRP process

**Simplified Metrics Approach via FRP:**

- **`planning_rational`**: Rule-based heuristic scoring (delegation patterns, tool usage)
- **`task_success`**: Binary completion detection (output validation against expected format)
- **`tool_efficiency`**: Simple counting metrics (tools called vs. results obtained)
- **`coordination_quality`**: Agent interaction counting (successful delegations)
- **`text_similarity`**: Basic string similarity (Levenshtein distance) before ML approaches
- **`time_taken`**: Already implemented, needs integration only

**Rationale**: Leverage Claude Code structured approach for risk reduction and quality assurance

#### **Phase 2: Architecture-Driven Enhancement (Days 3-5)**

**Backend-Architect Guided Judge Implementation:**

- Use backend-architect sub-agent for judge system architecture design
- FRP-structured implementation via `/generate-frp llm-judge-framework`
- API contract design and service boundary definition
- Scalable evaluation pipeline architecture

**Code-Reviewer Validation Throughout:**

- Proactive code review at each major milestone
- Security and performance validation
- AGENTS.md standards compliance verification
- Quality gate enforcement before progression

**Integration Strategy:**

- Build on backend-architect recommended patterns
- Leverage FRP-researched existing `agent_system.py` patterns
- Use structured evaluation result persistence
- Comprehensive testing with code-reviewer sub-agent validation

### **Risk Mitigation & Success Factors**

#### **Technical Dependencies - MANAGED**

**Potential Issues:**

- ML libraries for advanced similarity metrics
- API quota limits for judge evaluation
- Performance requirements for <2s latency

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- **Day 1**: Environment validation via `make setup_dev`
- **Fallback**: Rule-based implementations for all metrics
- **API Management**: Use development limits, rotate providers
- **Performance**: Profile incrementally, optimize after core functionality

#### **Scope Management - STREAMLINED**

**Success-Oriented Adjustments:**

1. **Focus on Framework over Perfection**: Establish extensible base rather than optimized metrics
2. **Leverage Existing Patterns**: Reuse agent, persistence, and config patterns throughout
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality first, advanced features after validation
4. **Documentation Alignment**: Update docs to match actual implementation rather than aspirational goals

#### **Resource Efficiency**

**Development Approach:**

- **Copy-Adapt Pattern**: Use existing agent patterns as templates
- **Config-Driven**: Leverage JSON configuration system for easy testing
- **Test-Driven**: Use existing pytest structure for validation
- **Incremental**: Each metric independently testable and deployable

### **Technology Evaluation & Enhancement Requests**

#### **Framework Alternative Analysis (LOW PRIORITY)**

**Hypothesis vs pytest:**

- **Current**: pytest integrated throughout project
- **Evaluation**: Hypothesis provides property-based testing for better edge case coverage
- **Decision**: **DEFER to post-sprint** - pytest sufficient for MVP, hypothesis adds complexity
- **Future Sprint**: Evaluate hypothesis for advanced evaluation scenario testing

**BAML vs Pydantic Models:**

- **Current**: Pydantic models deeply integrated (`app/data_models/`)
- **Evaluation**: BAML offers better LLM-native structured outputs
- **Decision**: **RESEARCH PHASE during Day 1** - evaluate integration complexity
- **Implementation**: Create proof-of-concept branch if promising
- **Risk**: High refactoring cost, could destabilize existing PeerRead integration

**LiteLLM vs Custom LLM Calls:**

- **Current**: Custom provider integration in `llm_model_funs.py`
- **Evaluation**: LiteLLM provides unified API for multiple providers
- **Decision**: **HIGH PRIORITY for Day 3** - Judge framework perfect use case
- **Implementation**: Use LiteLLM for new Judge system, leave existing agents unchanged
- **Benefit**: Simplified provider management for evaluation system

#### **Branch Strategy for Technology Evaluation**

**Branch Plan:**

1. **Main Development**: `feature/evaluation-framework`
   - Core sprint implementation
   - Conservative approach using existing tech stack

2. **Research Branches** (parallel investigation):

   - `research/baml-integration` - BAML data model evaluation
   - `research/litellm-judges` - LiteLLM integration for judges
   - `research/hypothesis-testing` - Property-based testing POC

**Integration Strategy:**

- Research branches validate concepts without blocking main development
- Successful research merged into main branch by Day 4
- Failed experiments documented for future reference
