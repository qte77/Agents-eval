# Sprint 1: PeerRead Dataset Agent Evaluation Framework

## Sprint Dates: August 23-28, 2025 (6 Days)

**Sprint Goal**: Implement a focused, streamlined three-tiered evaluation framework (Traditional + LLM-as-Judge + Graph-based) for assessing multi-agent systems on PeerRead scientific paper review generation with minimal complexity and maximum efficiency.

**Priority**: Critical Priority for evaluation framework foundation and Sprint 2 architectural prerequisites

## Claude Code Agent Strategy

**Sprint 1 leverages a specialized combination of existing and custom agents for optimal implementation:**

### **Agent Composition**

- `backend-architect` - Backend system architecture and API implementation
- `agent-systems-architect` - Multi-agent system coordination and workflow development  
- `python-performance-expert` - Python optimization and performance tuning
- `evaluation-specialist` - Evaluation framework design and metrics analysis
- `code-reviewer` - Code quality review and validation
- `python-developer` - Python development specialist for clean, maintainable code

### **Agent Deployment Strategy**

**MANDATORY ROLE SEPARATION** - Each phase must respect strict role boundaries:

- **Architecture Phase** (Days 1-2): `backend-architect` + `agent-systems-architect` + `evaluation-specialist` **DESIGN ONLY**
  - **FORBIDDEN**: Any code implementation or testing
  - **REQUIRED**: Complete specification files before handoff
- **Implementation Phase** (Days 2-4): `python-developer` + `python-performance-expert` **IMPLEMENT ONLY**
  - **FORBIDDEN**: Architectural decisions without architect approval
  - **REQUIRED**: Follow architect specifications exactly
- **Quality Assurance** (Days 4-6): `code-reviewer` **REVIEW ONLY**
  - **FORBIDDEN**: Implementation or architectural changes
  - **REQUIRED**: Immediate use after every code implementation

**Agent integration provides specialized expertise for multi-agent system architecture, evaluation framework design, performance optimization, and security validation throughout the sprint.**

## **MANDATORY HANDOFF REQUIREMENTS**

**Architecture → Implementation Handoff:**
- **REQUIRED**: All architects must create complete specification files before any implementation begins
- **VALIDATION**: Developers must confirm specifications are complete or request clarification
- **NO IMPLEMENTATION**: Without complete architect handoff documentation

**Post-Implementation Review:**
- **MANDATORY**: `code-reviewer` must be used immediately after every code implementation
- **COMPLIANCE**: All code must pass `make validate` before review
- **PATTERN ADHERENCE**: Code must follow existing codebase patterns exactly
- **USER APPROVAL**: After each task completion, present results to user and request approval before proceeding

### **Subagent Usage Examples**

#### **Interactive Usage (Recommended)**

Start Claude Code interactively, then use Task tool:

```bash
claude
# Then within the session:
Task("Evaluate PDF processing capabilities", subagent_type="backend-architect")
Task("Design evaluation framework architecture", subagent_type="evaluation-specialist") 
Task("Plan multi-agent coordination workflow", subagent_type="agent-systems-architect")

# IMPORTANT: After ANY code implementation, immediately use:
Task("Review implementation code quality", subagent_type="code-reviewer")
```

#### **Headless/CLI Usage**

Direct command-line invocation for automation:

```bash
# Architecture Phase Examples
claude --print 'Task("Evaluate PDF processing capabilities", subagent_type="backend-architect")'
claude --print 'Task("Design evaluation framework architecture", subagent_type="evaluation-specialist")'
claude --print 'Task("Plan multi-agent coordination workflow", subagent_type="agent-systems-architect")'

# Implementation Phase Examples
claude --print 'Task("Implement traditional evaluation metrics per architect specs", subagent_type="python-developer")'
claude --print 'Task("Optimize NetworkX graph performance per architect specs", subagent_type="python-performance-expert")'
claude --print 'Task("Implement Manager→Researcher→Analyst→Synthesizer per architect specs", subagent_type="python-developer")'
claude --print 'Task("Implement clean Python code following architect specifications", subagent_type="python-developer")'

# Quality Assurance Examples
claude --print 'Task("Review evaluation framework code quality", subagent_type="code-reviewer")'

# CRITICAL: After EVERY code implementation step, run:
claude --print 'Task("Review implementation code quality", subagent_type="code-reviewer")'

# MANDATORY: Present results to user and request approval before proceeding:
# "Task completed. Please review the results and approve before proceeding to next task."
```

#### **Task Categories by Sprint Phase**

```python
# Architecture Phase (Days 1-2) - DESIGN ONLY
Task("Design PDF processing architecture", subagent_type="backend-architect")
Task("Design evaluation framework specifications", subagent_type="evaluation-specialist") 
Task("Design multi-agent coordination architecture", subagent_type="agent-systems-architect")

```

## Executive Summary

**Project Goal**: Assess and evaluate AI agents on the PeerRead dataset by implementing a focused, minimal evaluation framework that efficiently measures agent performance in generating academic paper reviews through streamlined evaluation approaches.

**Key Requirements**:

- Large context window models to ingest full PeerRead dataset papers
- Traditional evaluation metrics (text similarity, execution time)
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation for review quality and agentic execution assessment
- Graph-based complexity analysis of tool and agent interactions
- Composite scoring system: (agentic results / execution time / graph complexity)

**Package Maintenance Requirements**:

- **MANDATORY**: Use only actively maintained packages (max 6 months since last release). Avoid legacy, obsolete, or unmaintained libraries.
- **MANDATORY**: Verify package maintenance status before adding dependencies
- **MANDATORY**: Prioritize lightweight alternatives to heavy transformer libraries ❌ **AVOID HEAVY PACKAGES** - Prioritize lightweight alternatives to transformer-based libraries

**Sprint Goals**: Implement focused, minimal PeerRead evaluation framework with streamlined traditional, LLM-judge, and graph-based evaluation approaches for efficient agent performance scoring. See [Evaluation Approach Decision Tree](../architecture.md#evaluation-approach-decision-tree) for guidance on approach selection.

## Three-Tiered Evaluation Engine Strategy

The Sprint 1 implementation follows a progressive three-tier approach, allowing selection of appropriate evaluation depth based on requirements and constraints.

### **Tier 1: Traditional Metrics Engine**

**Status**: Minimal foundation implementation
**Scope**: Essential text similarity and performance metrics only
**Tools**: Lightweight packages, e.g., torchmetrics[text], scikit-learn, nltk, textdistance. See for reference: [Landscape of Traditional Metrics Libraries](../landscape/landscape.md#traditional-metrics-libraries)
**Sprint Priority**: High - Streamlined foundation  
**Implementation**: Day 1-2 with **minimal dependencies** for fast installation and low disk usage  
**Performance Target**: <1s evaluation time, **<50MB additional dependencies**

### **Tier 2: LLM-as-a-Judge Engine**

**Status**: Streamlined implementation (Tasks 2.1, 2.2)  
**Scope**: Essential quality assessment with minimal prompt complexity
**Tools**: Basic LLM evaluation with existing project patterns
**Implementation**: Days 2-3 with simple LLM provider integration
**Performance Target**: 5-10s evaluation time, minimal API costs

### **Tier 3: Graph-Based Analysis Engine**

**Status**: Minimal graph analysis implementation (Tasks 3.1-3.3)  
**Scope**: Essential agent interaction patterns and basic coordination metrics
**Tools**: NetworkX only (minimal graph processing)
**Sprint Priority**: Medium - Basic multi-agent interaction analysis  
**Implementation**: Days 3-4 with simple trace processing and basic graph metrics  
**Performance Target**: 5-15s analysis time, lightweight and efficient

### **Progressive Implementation Strategy for Sprint 1**

**Days 1-2 (Foundation)**: Tier 1 → Essential metrics with minimal observability infrastructure  
**Days 2-3 (Assessment)**: Tier 1+2 → Add basic quality assessment  
**Days 3-4 (Analysis)**: All Tiers → Essential interaction analysis  
**Days 4-6 (Integration)**: Streamlined Tiers → Minimal pipeline with focused scoring

### **Local Observability Infrastructure (Critical for Tier 3)**

**Implementation Requirements** (Tasks 1.4, 2.3):

- **AgentNeo Integration**: Local JSON/JSONL tracing with essential agent execution logging
- **Comet Opik Integration**: Local storage capabilities for trace analysis and behavioral pattern extraction  
- **Trace File Structure**: `./logs/traces/` directory with timestamped execution traces for offline graph construction
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Agent coordination patterns, tool usage effectiveness, and delegation sequences
- **Post-execution Analysis**: Graph construction from execution traces for Tier 3 behavioral analysis

## Evaluation Framework Overview

### Traditional Evaluation Metrics (from config_eval.json)

- **Output Similarity**: Compare generated reviews to PeerRead reference reviews using HuggingFace evaluate library and sklearn for cosine, jaccard, and semantic similarity  
- **Time Taken**: Measure agent processing time for paper ingestion and review generation
- **Task Success**: Assess successful completion of review generation task with confidence threshold (0.8)

### Advanced Evaluation Metrics (from config_eval.json)

- **Coordination Quality**: Assess multi-agent interactions and workflow efficiency between Manager/Researcher/Analyst/Synthesizer
- **Tool Efficiency**: Evaluate effectiveness of DuckDuckGo search and PeerRead-specific tools usage
- **Planning Rational**: Assess reasoning quality and decision-making processes in agent orchestration

### Graph-Based Complexity Analysis

- **Tool Call Complexity**: Analyze patterns and efficiency of tool utilizations
- **Agent Interaction Graphs**: Map and measure complexity of agent-to-agent communications  
- **Execution Flow Analysis**: Compare actual vs. expected execution patterns

### Composite Scoring Formula (from config_eval.json)

```python
# Equal weights for all 6 metrics (0.167 each)
Agent Score = (
    time_taken * 0.167 +
    task_success * 0.167 + 
    coordination_quality * 0.167 +
    tool_efficiency * 0.167 +
    planning_rational * 0.167 +
    output_similarity * 0.167
)
```

**Recommendation Weights**: Accept (1.0), Weak Accept (0.7), Weak Reject (-0.7), Reject (-1.0)  
**Confidence Threshold**: 0.8 for task success evaluation

### Model Requirements

- **Large Context Windows**: Models capable of processing full PeerRead papers (>50k tokens, preferably 200k+ for full papers)
- **Suggested Models** (see [Available Models](../landscape.md#available-models) for detailed comparisons):
  - **Claude 4 Opus/Sonnet** (1M context limit, Anthropic provider)
  - **GPT-4 Turbo** (128k context limit, OpenAI provider)  
  - **Gemini-1.5-Pro** (1M context limit, Google provider)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Intelligent document chunking for smaller context models
- **Implementation**: Model selection logic based on paper token count with automatic fallback

### Implementation Requirements

**Sprint 1 will implement:**

- Config-based evaluation system using `config_eval.json`
- Traditional metrics: output similarity, execution time, task success  
- Advanced metrics: coordination quality, tool efficiency, planning rationality
- Graph-based complexity analysis with NetworkX
- Composite scoring system with weighted formula

**Implementation details and code architecture will be generated by specialized agents during sprint execution.**
