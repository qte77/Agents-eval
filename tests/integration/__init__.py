"""
Integration tests for the Agents-eval framework.

This module contains integration tests that validate end-to-end workflows,
component interactions, and real-world usage patterns for the evaluation system.

Integration tests differ from unit tests by:
- Testing multiple components working together
- Using realistic data sets and scenarios  
- Validating complete workflows and pipelines
- Testing external integrations and data formats
