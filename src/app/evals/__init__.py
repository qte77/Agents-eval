Evaluation frameworks and metrics module.

This module provides comprehensive evaluation capabilities for multi-agent systems:
- Tier 1: Traditional metrics (text similarity, execution performance)
- Tier 2: LLM-as-Judge evaluation (quality assessment using language models)
- Tier 3: Graph-based analysis (agent coordination and trace analysis)

The evaluation framework supports both PeerRead academic paper review tasks
and general multi-agent system assessment.
